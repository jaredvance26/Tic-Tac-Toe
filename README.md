# Overview



I wrote a tic-tac-toe game in Java. The game board was created with a hashmap of numbers. The board had each number displayed, and whatever number you chose, that is where your "X" or "O" went. Once you got 3 in a row, then you won the game.


The purpose I wrote this software was to gain a foundation of Java syntax. Java has always intimidated me and I wanted to learn it for myself.
